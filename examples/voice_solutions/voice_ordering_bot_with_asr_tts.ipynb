    "### Voice Chatbot with ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this cookbook, we will walk through the process of creating a simple sales chatbot with automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities. We'll use a GPT model via the Chat Completions API to drive the conversation with the user. At the end of the interaction, the chatbot will present an order cart containing the items the user wishes to purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Voice chatbots based on ASR/TTS can introduce latency due to the speech-to-text and text-to-speech conversion processes. We will explore strategies to minimize this lag to ensure a better conversational flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating an ASR/TTS-based voice chatbot is a three-step process, as outlined below:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Set Up the GPT Model (Text-to-Text Modality)**  \n",
    "Initialize the GPT model with system prompts that define the goal of the conversation, guiding the chatbot's responses toward assisting with sales order placement. The prompts can be set up for a multi-assistant system, where one assistant drives the conversation with the customer and another assistant manages the cart in parallel. Also, set up tools for assistants to use when asking for human help or interacting with each other (such as cart pricing).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Develop Audio Modules for ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) and TTS (Text-To-Speech)**  \n",
    "Create an audio interface that listens to the user, records their speech, and forwards the audio data to the ASR solution (such as Whisper) to transcribe it to text. Depending on the platform, implement an audio chunking strategy that segments the audio at silence intervals. Keep the threshold and duration of silence configurable based on the environment. Set up a TTS interface that, given an input text, converts the text to audio and speaks it back to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Create a conversation loop and manage order cart**  \n",
    "Implement a conversation loop where the agent listens to the user and responds back, continuing until an event occurs that breaks the loop, such as a request to speak with a human or another indication of the end of the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overarching solution architecture is as follows:   \n",

    "The key challenges we want to address are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ensure customers can only order items that are available.\n",
    "2. Escalate to a human in the loop if the customer requests help or engages in non-order-related conversation.\n",
    "3. Provide an accurate summary of the order with prices to the customer.\n",
    "4. Minimize the lag in the conversation \n",
