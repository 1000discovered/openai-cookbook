    "**Disclaimer: This cookbook is for educational purposes only. Ensure that you comply with all applicable laws and service terms when using web search and scraping technologies. This cookbook will restrict the search to openai.com domain to retrieve the public information illustrate the concepts.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have a knowledge cutoff date, which means they lack information about events that occurred after that point. In scenarios where the most recent data is essential, it's necessary to provide LLMs with access to current web information to ensure accurate and relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we will build a Bring Your Own Browser (BYOB) tool using Python to overcome this limitation. Our goal is to create a system that helps us compile a list of the most recent product launches by OpenAI. By integrating web search capabilities with an LLM, we'll enable the model to generate responses based on the latest information available online.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you can use any publicly available search APIs, we'll utilize Google's Custom Search API to perform web searches. The retrieved information from the search results will be processed and passed to the LLM to generate the final response through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bring Your Own Browser (BYOB)** tools allow users to perform web browsing tasks programmatically. In this notebook, we'll create a BYOB tool that:\n",

    "#1 Performs web searches using a publicly available API such as the Google Custom Search API.  \n",
    "#2 Retrieves and cleans text content from web pages, and Summarizes the content using an LLM such as gpt-4o-mini    \n",
    "#3 Performs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate a final outcome with reference to sources\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up a BYOB tool\n",
    "Before we begin, ensure you have the following: **Python 3.7 or later** installed on your machine. You will also need a Google Custom Search API key and Custom Search Engine ID (CSE ID). Necessary Python packages installed: `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `openai`. And ensure the OPENAI_API_KEY is set up as an environment variable."
