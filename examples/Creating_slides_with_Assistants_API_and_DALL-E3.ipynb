    "This notebook illustrates the use of the new [**Assistants API**](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview) and [**DALL-E3**](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images?context=node) in crafting informative and visually appealing slides. <br>\n",
    "Creating engaging slides is a pivotal aspect of many jobs, but it can be a laborious and time-consuming task. Additionally, extracting insights from data and articulating them effectively on slides can be challenging. <br><br> This cookbook recipe will demonstrate how you can utilize the new Assistants API, with GPT-Vision, and DALL-E3 to create slides for you without you having to touch Microsoft PowerPoint or Google Slides, saving you valuable time and effort!"
